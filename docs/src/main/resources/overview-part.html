    The purpose of Mapfish Print is to create reports that contain maps (and map related components) within them.
</p>
<p>
    The project is a Java based servlet/library/application based on the mature
    <a href="http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library">Jasper Reports Library</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Mapfish print has the following distributions:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The most commonly used distribution is the <em>war</em> distribution where Mapfish Print is a servlet and can be ran in a
            Servlet container like <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mapfish print is also distributed as a Java <em>jar</em> which allows Mapfish print to be used like a normal Java library, or
            embedded in an existing Java web application as an addition servlet
        </li>
        <li>
            The Java <em>war</em> is also packaged as a debian package
        </li>
        <li>
            The last distribution is an command-line application where the reports can be generated via command line.  This is useful for
            debugging configurations and requests.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>The (much simplified) architecture of Mapfish Print is as follows:</p>
<span class="architecture" ng-include="'Mapfish_Print_V3_Architecture.svg'"></span>
<p>
    This diagram illustrates how a client (web-client or Java application) communicates with the Mapfish Print Server.  In the case of a Java application
    the communication is directly with the Java Servlet Object and for web-client via http requests.  The protocol consists of several requests, only a few of which are shown in the dialgram.  Full the full list of requests see: <a href="#/api">the Protocol page.</a>

    Typically the request sequence the client uses is as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>
            If the client is a generic client, the client will make a capabilities request in order to obtain information about the required <a href="#/attributes">attributes</a> needed to be sent to the server.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next the create request will be made and all the <a href="#/attributes">attributes</a> (the data required in order to print the report) are sent to the server.  The server will return a reference ID of the print job for obtaining the report and the status
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the create request returns the client will poll the server asking about the status of the print.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the status request returns the completion response (and not an error) then the client will make the GET report request.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    On the server side, once a create request is recieved the server will create a Print Job and send it to Job Manager, which is responsible for running the print job asynchronously (possibly on a completely different server) and allowing the http request to return a response to the user without waiting for the print job to complete.  As an aside, there is a createAndGet request that will wait until the printing is done and directly return the report without having to poll to see if the print is done.  This is a convenience for client makers.
</p>
<p>
    While creating the Print Job all of the <a href="#/attributes">attributes</a> are parsed from the JSON and a Job Reference Id is generated to uniquely identify the job is create.
</p>
<p>
    Once the Print Job is started, the <a href="#/attributes">attributes</a> are passed to the <a href="#/processors">processors</a>.  The processor work with the <a href="#/attributes">attributes</a> in order to generate the maps, tables, legends, etc... that are required by the <a href="#/outputFormat">output format</a> (Jasper template).
</p>
<p>
    Once the <a href="#/processors">processors</a> have all completed execution all of the values are passed to the <a href="#/outputFormat">output format</a> which uses that information to generate the report.  In theory an <a href="#/outputFormat">output format</a> could be anything that generates a report.  However the current version uses the
    <a href="http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library">Jasper Reports Library</a> for its outputs and several of the processors are Jasper reports focuses.
    Because of this the documentation will assume that the output format is always based on
    <a href="http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library">Jasper Reports</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="#/outputFormat">output format</a> will generate a report and store it in some way for later retrieval.  At this point the status request would return a response indicating that the print job has completed.
